    <h2>How to make lasagna</h2>
    <p>Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple lasagna crust:</p>

    <ul  class="container">      
        <li>Meat: <em>This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</em></li><br>
        <li>Onion garlic: <em>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</em></li><br>
        <li>Tomato products: <em>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</em></li><br>
        <li>Sugar: <em>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</em></li><br>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: <em>This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</em></li><br>
        <li>lasagna noodles: <em>Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</em></li><br>
        <li>Cheeses: <em>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra decadent.</em></li><br>
        <li>Egg: <em>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when you cut into it.</em></li><br>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps:</h2>

        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li><br>
