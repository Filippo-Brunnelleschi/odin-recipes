    <h2>How to make pizza</h2>
    <p>Making pizza can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust:</p>

    <ul>      
        <li>Meat: <em>This super meaty pizza has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground beef.</em></li><br>
        <li>Onion garlic: <em>An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the meat to add tons of flavor.</em></li><br>
        <li>Tomato products: <em>You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</em></li><br>
        <li>Sugar: <em>Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance the flavor of the sauce.</em></li><br>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: <em>This pizza recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</em></li><br>
        <li>pizza noodles: <em>Use store-bought or homemade pizza noodles.</em></li><br>
        <li>Cheeses: <em>Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this pizza extra decadent.</em></li><br>
        <li>Egg: <em>An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the pizza when you cut into it.</em></li><br>
    </ul>
<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li><br>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</em></li><br>
        <li>Let rest for 5 minutes.</li><br>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li><br>
        <li>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li><br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li><br>
    </ol>
