    <h2>How to make Pizza</h2>
    <p>Making pizza can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics:</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <p>The Allrecipes community adores this pizza recipe because it's incredibly customizable, so you can easily alter the ingredient list to suit your needs. If you want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll need to add to your grocery list:</p>

    <ul>      
        <li>Yeast: <em>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the pizza dough to rise.</em></li><br>
        <li>Sugar: <em>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</em></li><br>
        <li>Bread Flour: <em>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust elasticity.</em></li><br>
        <li>Olive Oil: <em>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.</em></li><br>
        <li>Salt: <em>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</em></li><br>
    </ul>
<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the meat sauce</li><br>
        <li>Cook the noodles</li><br>
        <li>Make the ricotta mixture</em></li><br>
        <li>Layer the pizza</li><br>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake</li><br>
        <li>Let the pizza rest before serving</li><br>
    </ol>
